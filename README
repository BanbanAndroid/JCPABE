1. Download the source of JPBC from http://sourceforge.net/p/jpbc/code/HEAD/tree/tags/2_0_0/
Install it into your local maven repository using:
> mvn install

2. Download the JavaCC binary (6.1.2 works) from https://java.net/projects/javacc/downloads/directory/releases
and place the javacc.jar into <repo>/javacc/bin/lib/ 
(Alternatively change line 6 of the build.xml file to point towards JavaCC.)

3. Go to the jcpabe/ folder and do either
> mvn install
to install JCPABE to your local maven repository or do
> mvn package
to generate the jcpabe-1.0.0.jar file.
